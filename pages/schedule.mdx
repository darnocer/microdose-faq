# How do you take the microdose and how often?

Typically, you'll consume the dose in 1-2 capsules at the beginning of your day. There are a few accepted regimens for microdosing. We include two widely recognized protocols below.

Again, there is no one size fits all when it comes to psychedelics. The below protocols were designed by experts based on anecdotal evidence, and include "off" days in order to prevent tolerance buildup and maximize the potential benefits by allowing time for the insights to be integrated. **Above all, always listen to your mind and body, taking breaks when needed.**

  With any regimen, it's typically advisable to take periodic breaks for an
  extended time. For instance, following one of the protocols for 2-3 months and
  then taking an extended break for 2-4 weeks, in order to reflect on and
  integrate your experience.

## The Stamets Protocol (Psilocybin)

Paul Stamets, a renowned mycologist and advocate for medicinal use of mushrooms, proposes to take microdoses two days in a row and then take two days off, repeating this cycle indefinitely.

Stamets also suggests supplementing psilocybin with Lion's Mane mushrooms and niacin (Vitamin B3). While he doesn't offer a recommended dosage of the supplements, a typical dosage of Lion's Mane ranges from 300 - 1000mg.

The dose of niacin should be enough to induce a "flush," which indicates increased peripheral circulation, potentially aiding the distribution of the neurogenic benefits of the mushrooms. This is typically around 100mg of niacin. However, niacin should be used with caution, as high doses can cause uncomfortable skin flushing or itching.

## The Fadiman Protocol (LSD)

James Fadiman, a prominent figure in psychedelic research, suggests taking a microdose once every 3 days.

For example, take a dose on Day 1, take two days off (on Day 2 and 3), and take the next dose on Day 4. This allows time for integration without continuous reliance on the substance.

Fadiman also suggests keeping a journal to record your observations of your thoughts, mood changes, and cognition, and to adjust the dosage or schedule based on personal goals.
