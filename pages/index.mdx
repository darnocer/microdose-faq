# Welcome to microdose.wiki!

## Objective

Our aim is to provide accurate information to promote the safe, respectful, informed, and effective usage of psilocybin mushrooms, specifically microdosing for therapeutic use.

## Why we created this site

With the recent dialogue surrounding legalizing psychedelics for therapeutic usage, interest in these powerful substances is surging in the mainstream. Since the prohibition of psychedelic drugs in 1970, there has been widespread misinformation and many misconceptions about the usage of these sacred medicines. One practice that has been gaining popularity is "microdosing," taking small doses doses on a regular basis to improve mood, creatvitiy, or cognition. We created this site to guide that curiosity towards safe and informed practices. Our mission is to dispel myths, offer accurate information, and foster a respectful approach to using these powerful natural medicines, emphasizing their potential for transformation when used responsibly.
