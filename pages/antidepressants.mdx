# Should you avoid microdosing while taking antidepressants?

<Callout type="error">
  **AVOID MICRODOSING WITH LSD IF YOU ARE MEDICATIONS CONTAINING LITHIUM. LSD
  COMBINED WITH LITHIUM CAN CAUSE SEIZURES AND COMA.**
</Callout>

Many people may want to try microdosing as a means of weening themselves off of antidepressant medication. Never stop taking medication abruptly.

Anecdotally, some people have reported safely taking psychedelics while on SSRIs. Some people have reported no or diminished psychedelic effects while on certain medications. Always do your own research so you are informed of the risks. Always work with your doctor or a trained professional if you're considering microdosing while taking SSRIs.

While we've primarily covered LSD and psilocybin, note it's also possible to microdose with ayahuasca, although **it is not recommended to use ayahuasca in any dose without the presence of an experienced spiritual guide**. We mention this because it is _especially_ dangerous to take ayahuasca while on SSRIs.
