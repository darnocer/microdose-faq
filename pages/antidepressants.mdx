# Should you avoid microdosing while taking antidepressants?

Many people may want to try microdosing as a means of weening themselves off of antidepressant medication. Never stop taking medication abruptly. Work with your doctor or a trained professional if considering microdosing especially if you're taking SSRIs.

While we've primarily covered LSD and psilocybin, it's also possible to microdose with ayahuasca, although it is not recommended to use ayahuasca in any dose without the presence of an experienced spiritual guide. Note that it is especially dangerous to take ayahuasca while on SSRIs.
