# What is the proper dosage for microdosing?

There is technically no established standard for microdosing; however, it is generally accepted that a "microdose" is 1/10th to 1/20th of a "normal" dose. So for psilocybin, a microdose would be considered about 0.1 - 0.2g (100-200mg) of dried mushroom material, considering that a dose high enough to induce a "trip" is typically about 1 - 2g of dried mushrooms.

It's important to note that we are talking about the weight of the _dried mushroom material_. This is not the same weight as _psilocybin_, the active ingredient. The actual dosage of psilocybin will vary greatly depending on the strain and strength of the mushroom, but is generally estimated to be about 10% of the weight of the mushroom.

So, in a 0.1g (or 100mg) microdose, you can expect the dose of psilocybin to be approximately 10mg. Keep this in mind if you are microdosing with anything other than dried mushroom material, such as with an extract or mushroom chocolate.

We recommend that you start on the lower end. 100mg of dried mushrooms (or 10mg of psilocybin) is typically a good starting point. Then, you can work your way up to find the optimal dose for you. It’s generally accepted that exceeding about 300mg of dried mushrooms is moving into “minidose” territory.
