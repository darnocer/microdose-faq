# What are the risks of microdosing?

## General Risks

1. **Cardiac Risks (LSD):**
   There is some evidence that shows long-term use of LSD may potentially cause cardiac risks, specifically for people who suffer from cardiac conditions.

2. **Anxiety:**
   While microdosing may aid with symptoms of depression or anxiety, if you're feeling overly anxious, you may want to avoid microdosing any substances altogether. If you choose to microdose and already struggle with anxiety, avoid all caffeine and stimulants. Always consider set (your mindset) and setting (your environment) when choosing to microdose.

3. **Taking too much:**
   The powerful psychoactive effects of psychedelics and the resulting state of consciousness is not considered compatible with everyday socialization. While there have been no reports of accidentally consuming a full dose when attempting to microdose, it is possible to toe the line into a "minidose" that may make for uncomfortable or challenging situations. Always measure your dose. It's best to try microdosing for the first time on a day where you have minimal responsibilities in order to avoid a situation where you may accidentally overdo it and find yourself anxious in a less-than-ideal scenario like at work.

4. **Impulsivity:**
   Microdosing and psychedelics can cause impulsivity. Avoid making major life decisions while under the influence of psychedelics. It is generally recommended to wait 2-4 weeks since using any psychedelics before committing to a life-changing decision.

## Additional Risk Factors

Microdosing is not for everyone. Take caution in working with sacred natural medicines if you:

- Are pregnant
- Have a history of psychosis, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder
- Are currently experiencing abnormally high states of stress, anxiety, or grief
- Are experiencing long-term illness
- Suffer from seizures
- Are taking SSRIs or medications with Lithium
