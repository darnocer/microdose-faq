# What does the science say about the effectiveness of microdosing?

There is much more research on the effects of higher-dose psychedelic journeys, and less so on the effects of microdosing. As such, there is not currently conclusive evidence that microdosing is effective in any particular area, and much of our understanding about the effects of microdosing comes from anecdotal reports.

Here is some recent literature on the topic:

- [Thomas Anderson Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30604183/)
- Dutch Psychedelic Society Microdosing Event
- [Dr. James Fadiman author of "The Psychedelic Explorers Guide"](https://www.amazon.com/Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic-Journeys/dp/1594774021)
- "Might microdosing be safe and beneficial?"
- Psychedelic Microdosing: Prevalence and Subjective Effects
