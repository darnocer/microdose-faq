# How can you ensure the best possible experience with microdosing?

The classic "Psychedelics 101" advice is to be mindful of your set and setting. "Set" refers to your "mindset," how you are feeling internally. "Setting" refers to your external environment, including the atmosphere. Always consider your set and setting before choosing to partake in psychedelic consumption, microdosing or otherwise.

It's suggested to try microdosing for the first time on a day off with minimal responsibilities in order to familiarize yourself with the effects.
