# How does microdosing psilocybin vs. LSD differ?

The reported differences between psilocybin and LSD are purely anecdotal. Many people find microdosing with LSD to be more about the "mind" and psilocybin to be more about the "heart". Many people find LSD more energizing and psilocybin to be more relaxing. It's important to note there is no one size fits all and your experience may differ. 

We will primarily be discussing microdosing with psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in “magic” mushrooms. We will call out any notes specific to microdosing with LSD or other psychedelics.
