# Could the positive benefits just be a placebo?

It's certainly a possibility that the positive effects of microdosing may be a placebo; however, it doesn't necessarily undermine the legitimacy of those effects. Placebos are an inert substance that can induce real physiological and psychological effects resulting from oneâ€™s beliefs and expectations for improvement. So, if individuals experience benefits to their well-being from microdosing, then it remains a valuable practice, whether the effects are pharmacological or caused by the power of belief.

  Studies have shown that 25% to 80% of the overall effectiveness of
  antidepressant medications, depending on the medication, can also be
  attributed to the placebo effect.
