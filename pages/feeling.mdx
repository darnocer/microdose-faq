# What does microdosing feel like?

The idea for a regular microdosing regimen is to take a dose low enough to be ["subperceptual"](/subperceptual). A "subperceptual" dose is a [dose](/dosage) small enough in which you can carry on your day normally, without feeling impaired or interfering with your daily schedule in any way.

The effects of a true microdose differ greatly from that of "macrodose" or a full-blown "trip," because with microdosing, you consume a dose that generally remains below your perceptual threshold. Exceeding this threshold is no longer technically considered a "microdose".

Before finding your optimal subperceptual dose, it is entirely possible you may feel stronger effects of psilocybin without actually "tripping". Sometimes a dose that exceeds that of a "microdose," but is not enough for the threshold of tripping, can cause some physical discomfort or anxiety. This is normal. If you took too much, the effects will pass in a few hours.

Of course, if at any point you do feel your perception is altered, it's important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until the effects have fully worn off.
