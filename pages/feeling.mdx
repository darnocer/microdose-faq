# What does microdosing feel like?

The idea is to take a "subperceptual" dose, in other words, ideally you do not actually notice more than very subtle effects when taking a true microdose. You should take a dose small enough in which you can carry on your day normally, without feeling impaired or interfering with your daily schedule in any way.

The effects of microdosing differ greatly from that of "macrodose" or a full-blown "trip," because with microdosing, you consume a dose that generally remains below your perceptual threshold. Exceeding this threshold is no longer considered a "microdose".

If at any point you do feel your perception is altered, it's important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until the effects have fully worn off.
