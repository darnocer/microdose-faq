# What are the known benefits of microdosing?

<Callout type="warning">`Todo:: cite sources`</Callout>

According to a study led by Thomas Anderson, the three most significantly reported benefits were:

1. Improved Mood
2. Increased Focus
3. Enhanced Creativity

The Thomas Anderson study investigated experiences of people who already microdose, showing promising results for further research. However, randomized placebo-controlled trials are still the gold standard for clinical research. The implications of how this study was conducted mean that it's possible that people that already had better mental health or higher creativity were more likely to experiment with microdosing.

In the absence of quantitative research, we still have thousands of anecdotal reports about the effects of microdosing, which include the following reported benefits:

- Boost in productivity
- Improved memory
- Increased intrinsic motivation
- Boost in sustained higher energy levels
- Can learn and retain new information more quickly

- More confidence
