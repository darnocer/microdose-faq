# What is the proper dosage for microdosing?

There is technically no "standard" for microdosing; however, most people believe a "microdose" to be 1/10th to 1/20th a normal dose. So for psilocybin, a microdose would be considered about 0.1 - 0.2g of dried mushroom material, considering that a dose high enough to induce a "trip" is about 1 - 2g of dried mushrooms.

It's important to note that we are talking about the weight of the dried mushroom material. This is not the same weight as psilocybin, the active ingredient. The actual dosage of psilocybin will vary greatly depending on the strain of the mushroom, but is generally estimated to be 10% of the weight of the mushroom. So, in a 0.1g (or 100mg) microdose, you can expect the dose of psilocybin to be approximately 10mg. 

We recommend that you start on the lower end. 100mg is typically a good starting point. Then, you can work your way up to find the optimal dose for you. It’s generally accepted that exceeding about 300mg is moving into “minidose” territory.
