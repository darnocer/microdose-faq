# How do you measure the proper dose? 

You may obtain microdose capsules already prepared for you, or you may purchase the dried mushrooms and prepare your own doses. When using capsules, ensure that you are aware of the contents as well as the measured dosages of each ingredient in the capsules. 

If preparing your own capsules, you can grind up the mushrooms into powder using a coffee grinder or food processor. You will want a small kitchen scale that registers one-thousandth of a gram, or in milligrams. You can purchase gelatin capsules from Amazon, typically size 0 or 00 works well. Use the scale to weigh the dose (0.1 - 0.2g) and fill the capsule. Ensure you are taking the weight of the capsule into account if you weight the capsules afterwards.
